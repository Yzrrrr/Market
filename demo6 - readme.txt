The code is called demo6. It is supposed to be a map but I don't know how to copy the latest demo map and
put my code in there.
The end of my python file shows a graph with Apple stock, combined with the text sentiment graph.
You would just have to scroll a long way down because of one of the outputs being long.
I wanted to make this sentiment analysis with Tesla as well, but the processing took too long. I will do it soon.
